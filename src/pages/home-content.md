### Concept
PhylumJS is a powerful async task runner for [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) that is designed for implementing large and complex build systems. It has a dynamic dependency tracking mechanism between tasks that makes task states reusable, provides a pull-push system for state updates and automatically re-executes tasks when needed.
